# Variables in Aggregation Expressions

Aggregation expressions can use both **user-defined** and **system variables**.

Variables can hold any `BSON` type data. To access the value of the variable, prefix the variable name with double **dollar signs** `($$)`, i.e. `"$$<variable>"`.

If the variable references an object, to access a specific field in the object, use the dot notation; i.e. `"$$<variable>.<field>"`.

## User Variables

User variable names **can contain** the ascii characters `[_a-zA-Z0-9]` and any non-ascii character.

User variable names **must begin with** a lowercase ascii letter `[a-z]` or a non-ascii character.

## System Variables

MongoDB offers the following system variables:

| Variable       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NOW`          | A variable that returns the current datetime value. <br>`NOW` returns the same value for all members of the deployment and remains the same throughout all stages of the aggregation pipeline.                                                                                                                                  |
| `CLUSTER_TIME` | A variable that returns the current timestamp value.<br>`CLUSTER_TIME` is only available on replica sets and sharded clusters.<br>`CLUSTER_TIME` returns the same value for all members of the deployment and remains the same throughout all stages of the pipeline.                                                           |
| `ROOT`         | References the root document, i.e. the top-level document, currently being processed in the aggregation pipeline stage.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `CURRENT`      | References the start of the field path being processed in the aggregation pipeline stage. Unless documented otherwise, all stages start with `CURRENT` the same as `ROOT`.<br>`CURRENT` is modifiable. However, since `$<field>` is equivalent to `$$CURRENT.<field>`, rebinding `CURRENT` changes the meaning of `$ accesses`. |
| `REMOVE`       | A variable which evaluates to the missing value. Allows for the conditional exclusion of fields. In a `$project`, a field set to the variable `REMOVE` is excluded from the output.                                                                                                                                             |
| `DESCEND`      | One of the allowed results of a `$redact` expression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `PRUNE`        | One of the allowed results of a `$redact` expression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `KEEP`         | One of the allowed results of a `$redact` expression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `SEARCH_META`  | A variable that stores the metadata results of an **Atlas Search query**. In all supported aggregation pipeline stages, a field set to the variable `$$SEARCH_META` returns the **metadata results** for the query.                                                                                                             |
