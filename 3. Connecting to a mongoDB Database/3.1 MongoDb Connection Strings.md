# MongoDB Connection Strings

## Connection String

A mongoDB connection string allows us to connect to our cluster and work with our data.
<br>
It describes a host that we we'll be using and the options for connection to a MongoDB database. For example, the connection string can be used to connect from the Mongo shell, MongoDB Compass or any other application.
There are 2 formats for connection strings provided by mongoDB:

-   **Standard format**: Used to connect to standalone clusters, replica sets, or sharded clusters.
-   **DNS seed list format**: Released in mongoDB 3.6. Alows us to provide a DNS server list to our connection string, which gives a lot more flexibility of deployment and the ability to change servers in rotation without reconfiguring clients.
