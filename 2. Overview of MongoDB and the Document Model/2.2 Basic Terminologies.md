# Basic Terminologies

**Database :** Structured way to store and access data
<br>

**NoSQL Database :** Datbase where data is not stored in the form of tables.
<br>

**MongoDB :** A NoSQL document database. Data is stored in the form of **collections** and **documents**.
<br>

**Field :** A unique identifier for a datapoint.
<br>

**Value :** Data related to a given identifier.
<br>

**Document :** A way to organize and store data as a set of field-value pairs. For ex:

```
    {
        <field>: <value>,
        <field>: <value>,
        "name": "CoderChirag",
        "title": "Web Developer",
        "age": 20
    }
```

<br>

**Collection :** An organized store of documents in MongoDB usually with common fields between documents. There can be many collections per database and many documents per collection.

# How does MongoDB store data?

## JSON

-   JavaScript Standard Object Notation
-   JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a human-readable data interchange format, specified in the early 2000s. Even though JSON is based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language standard, it’s completely language-independent.
    <br>
-   JSON objects are associative containers, wherein a string key is mapped to a value (which can be a number, string, boolean, array, an empty value — null, or even another object). Almost any programming language has an implementation for this abstract data structure — objects in JavaScript, dictionaries in Python, hash tables in Java and C#, associative arrays in C++, and so on. JSON objects are easy for humans to understand and for machines to parse and generate.

### Format

-   Start and end with curly braces `{}`
-   Separate each **key** and **value** with a colon `:`
-   Separate each `key:value` pair with a comma `,`
-   `"keys"` must be surrounded by quotation marks `" "`
    -   In MongoDb `"keys"` are called `"fields"`
-   Eg :
    ```
    {
        "_id" : "10021-2015-ENFO",
        "certificate_number" : 9278806,
        "business_name" : "ATLIXCO DELI",
        "date" : "Feb 20 2015",
        "result" : "No Violation Issued",
        "sector" : "Cigarette Retail - 127",
        "address" : {
            "city" : "RIDGEWOOD",
            "zip" : 11385,
            "street" : "MENAHAN ST",
            "number" : 1712
        }
    }
    ```

### Pros and Cons of JSON

| Pros of JSON | Cons of JSON                                              |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Friendly     | Text-based (Parsing is very difficult and time consuming) |
| Readable     | Space-consuming (Another concern for a database)          |
| Familiar     | Limited (Limited no. of data-types)                       |

### The MongoDB-JSON connection

MongoDB was designed from its inception to be a database focused on delivering great development experience. JSON’s ubiquity made it the obvious choice for representing data structures in MongoDB’s **document data model.**
<br>

However, there are several issues that make JSON less than ideal for usage inside of a database.

1. JSON only supports a limited number of basic data types. Most notably, JSON lacks support for dates and binary data.
2. JSON objects and properties don’t have fixed length which makes traversal slower.

In order to make MongoDB JSON-first, but still high performance and general purpose, BSON was invented to bridge the gap: a binary representation to store data in JSON format, optimized for speed, space, and efficiency. It’s not dissimilar from other binary interchange formats like Protocol Buffers, or Thrift, in terms of approach.
<br>
<br>

## BSON

-   Binary JSON
-   Bridges the gap between binary representation and JSON format
-   Optimized for :
    -   Speed
    -   Space
    -   Flexibility
-   High Performance
-   General-purpose focus
-   The following are some example JSON objects and their corresponding BSON representations.
    ````
    {"hello": "world"} →
    \x16\x00\x00\x00 // total document size
    \x02 // 0x02 = type String
    hello\x00 // field name
    \x06\x00\x00\x00world\x00 // field value
    \x00 // 0x00 = type EOO ('end of object')
        {"BSON": ["awesome", 5.05, 1986]} →
        \x31\x00\x00\x00
        \x04BSON\x00
        \x26\x00\x00\x00
        \x02\x30\x00\x08\x00\x00\x00awesome\x00
        \x01\x31\x00\x33\x33\x33\x33\x33\x33\x14\x40
        \x10\x32\x00\xc2\x07\x00\x00
        \x00
        \x00
        ```
    <br>
    ````

### Does MongoDB use BSON or JSON?

MongoDB stores data in BSON format both internally, and over the network, but that doesn’t mean you can’t think of MongoDB as a JSON database. Anything you can represent in JSON can be natively stored in MongoDB, and retrieved just as easily in JSON.
<br>

When using the **MongoDB driver** for your favorite programming language, you work with the native data structures for that language. The driver will take care of converting the data to BSON and back when querying the database.
<br>

Unlike systems that store JSON as string-encoded values, or binary-encoded blobs, MongoDB uses BSON to offer powerful indexing and querying features on top of the web’s most popular data format.
<br>

For example, MongoDB allows developers to query and manipulate objects by specific keys inside the JSON/BSON document, even in nested documents many layers deep into a record, and create high-performance indexes on those same keys and values.

## JSON vs BSON

|                  | JSON                           | BSON                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Encoding**     | UTF-8 String                   | Binary                                                                      |
| **Data Support** | String, Boolean, Number, Array | String, Boolean, Number(Integer, Long, Float, ...), Array, Date, Raw Binary |
| **Readability**  | Human and Machine              | Machine only                                                                |

## Importing and Exporting Data

-   Once we have some data in MongoDb Atlas, we can export this data to a local machine or to a different system.
-   We can also import the data from a different system and from a local machine to MongoDb Atlas.
    <br>

-   To export and import data, the choice of format should be made. We know data in BSON is very lightweight and can be transferred very easily, but is not human readable whereas JSON on the other hand is human readable.
    <br>

-   Here we would be viewing 4 commands :
    <br>

    | JSON                                       | BSON                                        |
    | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
    | `mongoimport` : import data in JSON format | `mongorestore` : import data in BSON format |
    | `mongoexport` : export data in JSON format | `mongodump` : export data in BSON format    |

**Note :** For executing these commands on your local system, you need to install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/), and [MongoDB Datbase Tools](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools/installation/installation/) on your system.

#### Exporting Data

`mongodump --uri "<Atlas Cluster URI>"`
<br>

Exports data in **BSON**
<br>

`mongoexport --uri "<Atlas Cluster URI>" --collection=<collection name> --out=<filename>.json`
<br>

Exports data in **JSON**

For eg,

```
mongodump --uri "mongodb+srv://<your username>:<your password>@<your cluster>.mongodb.net/sample_supplies"
# Dumps data to ./dump in BSON format

mongoexport --uri="mongodb+srv://<your username>:<your password>@<your cluster>.mongodb.net/sample_supplies" --collection=sales --out=sales.json
# Export data to ./sales.json file in JSON format
```

#### Importing Data

`mongorestore --uri "<Atlas Cluster URI>" --drop dump`
<br>

Imports data in **BSON** dump
<br>

`mongoimport --uri "<Atlas Cluster URI>" --drop=<filename>.json`
<br>

Imports data in **JSON**

```
mongorestore --uri "mongodb+srv://<your username>:<your password>@<your cluster>.mongodb.net/sample_supplies"  --drop dump


mongoimport --uri="mongodb+srv://<your username>:<your password>@<your cluster>.mongodb.net/sample_supplies" --drop sales.json
```
