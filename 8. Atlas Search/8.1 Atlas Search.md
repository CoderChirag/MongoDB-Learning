# Relevance Based Search

**Relevance Based Search** is a search used when an application end user seeks to surface records based on a search term.

**It's not a database search for a particular record.**

For example, you go to google and search for MongoDB Atlas Search, this is relevance based search.

# Atlas Search

Atlas Search is an embedded full-text search (**[relevance based search](#relevance-based-search)**) in MongoDB Atlas that gives you a seamless, scalable experience for building relevance-based app features. Built on **Apache Lucene**(an open source search algorithm), Atlas Search eliminates the need to run a separate search system alongside your database.

Atlas Search starts with **Search Indexes**, which are used to specify how the search algorithm should work with this set of data.

**Note: Search Indexes are NOT the same as Database Indexes.**

-   **Database Indexes** are used by developers and database administrators to make their frequent database queries easier and more efficient.
-   **Search Indexes** are used to specify how records are referenced for relevance-based search. The components of a **Search Index** includes information about **analyzers** that are being used (in most cases `lucene.standard`), the **type of mapping** (either `dynamic` or `static`), an **option to store whole documents in memory for faster post-aggregation performance**, and **field mappings**.

# Creating Atlas Search Index

You can create an Atlas Search index using the **Atlas UI**, **Atlas Search API**, or **Atlas CLI**.
We will be using **Atlas UI**.

## Atlas UI

1.  Navigate to the **Atlas Search page** for your project.
    -   If it is not already displayed, select the organization that contains your desired project from the **Organizations** menu in the navigation bar.
    -   If it is not already displayed, select your desired **project** from the Projects menu in the navigation bar.
    -   Click your cluster's name.
    -   Click the **Search** tab.
        ![search_page](./assets/search_page.jpg)
2.  Click **Create Search Index**.
3.  Select a Configuration Method and click **Next**.
    -   For a guided experience, select **Visual Editor**.
    -   To edit the raw index definition, select **JSON Editor**.
        ![conf_method](./assets/conf_method.jpg)
4.  Enter the **Index Name**, and set the **Database** and **Collection**.

    -   In the **Index Name** field, enter `default`.
    -   **Note :** If you name your index `default`, you don't need to specify an index parameter when using the `$search` pipeline stage. Otherwise, you must specify the index name using the index parameter.
    -   In the **Database and Collection** section, find the `sample_mflix` database, and select the `movies` collection.
        ![index_name](./assets/index_name.jpg)

5.  Specify an index definition.

    -   You can create an Atlas Search index that uses **dynamic mappings** or **static mappings**.
    -   **Dynamic Search** is for a dynamic search that looks through all of the fields for the user search term.
    -   However, if we have data with a lof of fields, only some of which an end user of an application might actually care about, we can show relevant results by **statically mapping** certain fields. This type of search index ias called **Static Indexing**.
    -   Since, we are looking at dynamic mapping, we will not have to give **Field mappings** here.
        <br>
    -   The following index definition dynamically indexes the fields of supported types in the movies collection. You can use the **Visual Editor** or the **JSON Editor** in the Atlas user interface to create the index.
        <br>
    -   **Visual Editor**
        -   Click **Next**.
        -   Review the `"default"` index definition for the `movies` collection.
            ![create_search_index](./assets/create_search_index.jpg)
    -   **JSON Editor**

        -   Click **Next**. - Review the index definition.
            Your index definition should look similar to the following:

                {
                    "mappings": {
                        "dynamic": true
                    }
                }

            The above index definition dynamically indexes the fields of supported types in each document in the movies collection. - Click **Next**.

6.  Click **Create Search Index**.
7.  Close the You're All Set! Modal Window.
    A modal window appears to let you know your index is building. Click the **Close** button.
    ![modal](./assets/modal.jpg)
8.  Wait for the index to finish building.
    The index should take about one minute to build. While it is building, the **Status** column reads `Build in Progress`. When it is finished building, the **Status** column reads `Active`.

# Using `$search` and Compound Operators.

In this section, you will learn how to improve your search by assigning weights to different fields using the compound operator so that when your user searches on your application, the most important results return first.

To do this, we will create an aggregation pipeline with a `$search` stage and then we will use the `$compount` operator to specify how the results should be ranked.

**Note :** Before proceeding further, make sure the appropriate **Search Index** is present in you Atlas Search section.

## `$search` stage

### Syntax

```
$search: {
    "index": "<index-name>",
    "<operator-name>"|"<collector-name>": {
        <operator-specification>|<collector-specification>
    },
    "highlight": {
        <highlight-options>
    },
    "count": {
        <count-options>
    },
    "returnStoredSource": true | false
}
```

## `$compound` operator

The `$compound` operator is nested in the search stage. And it includes clauses that specify the weight that the different fields should have in the same search ranking.

Those clauses are:

-   **must** - Only includes results that match the clause.
-   **must not** - Negation of **must**
-   **should** - Will assign a weight to records that match the clause.
-   **filter** - Eliminates any search results that do not match the clauses, but it does not affect the score.

## Example

Let's say we are creating an app for birders that want to learn about different species and we want to present those birders with birds with which they might be the most familiar.
We know that our users live in an area with a lot of grasslands and it's likely that they spotted birds that are larger because they're easier to see.
<br>

We would like to surface birds that live in **grasslands** and have a large **wingspans**

All our search results **must** be **birds** that inhabit **grasslands** and **should** have a **wingspan** greater than `75 centimeters`.

```
db.birds.aggregate([
    {
        $search: {
            "compound": {
                "must": [{
                    "text": {
                        "query": "grasslands",
                        "path": "habitat"
                    }
                }],
                "should": [{
                    "range": {
                        "gte": 75,
                        "path": "wingspan_cm",
                        "score": {"constant": {"value": 5}}
                    }
                }]
            }
        }
    },{ // If you want to see the search score, you can project it like this.
        $project: {
            score: {
                $meta: "searchScore"
            }
        }
    }
])
```
