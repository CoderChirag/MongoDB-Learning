# Relevance Based Search

**Relevance Based Search** is a search used when an application end user seeks to surface records based on a search term.

**It's not a database search for a particular record.**

For example, you go to google and search for MongoDB Atlas Search, this is relevance based search.

# Atlas Search

Atlas Search is an embedded full-text search (**[relevance based search](#relevance-based-search)**) in MongoDB Atlas that gives you a seamless, scalable experience for building relevance-based app features. Built on **Apache Lucene**(an open source search algorithm), Atlas Search eliminates the need to run a separate search system alongside your database.

Atlas Search starts with **Search Indexes**, which are used to specify how the search algorithm should work with this set of data.

**Note: Search Indexes are NOT the same as Database Indexes.**

-   **Database Indexes** are used by developers and database administrators to make their frequent database queries easier and more efficient.
-   **Search Indexes** are used to specify how records are referenced for relevance-based search. The components of a **Search Index** includes information about **analyzers** that are being used (in most cases `lucene.standard`), the **type of mapping** (either `dynamic` or `static`), an **option to store whole documents in memory for faster post-aggregation performance**, and **field mappings**.
