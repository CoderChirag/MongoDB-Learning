# Indexes

Indexes support the efficient execution of queries in MongoDB. Without indexes, MongoDB must perform a collection scan, i.e. scan every document in a collection, to select those documents that match the query statement. If an appropriate index exists for a query, MongoDB can use the index to limit the number of documents it must inspect.

Indexes are special data structures (MongoDB indexes use a B-tree data structure.) that store a small portion of the collection's data set in an easy to traverse form. The index stores the value of a specific field or set of fields, ordered by the value of the field. The ordering of the index entries supports efficient equality matches and range-based query operations. In addition, MongoDB can return sorted results by using the ordering in the index.

The following diagram illustrates a query that selects and orders the matching documents using an index:

Fundamentally, indexes in MongoDB are similar to indexes in other database systems. MongoDB defines indexes at the collection level and supports indexes on any field or sub-field of the documents in a MongoDB collection.

## Default `_id` Index

MongoDB creates a unique index on the `_id` field during the creation of a collection. The `_id` index prevents clients from inserting two documents with the same value for the `_id` field. You cannot drop this index on the `_id` field.

## Create an Index

To create an index in the Mongo Shell, use `db.collection.createIndex()`.

```
db.collection.createIndex( <key and index type specification>, <options> )
```

The following example creates a single key descending index on the name field:

```
db.collection.createIndex( { name: -1 } )
```

The `db.collection.createIndex()` method only creates an index if an index of the same specification does not already exist.

### Index Names

The default name for an index is the concatenation of the indexed keys and each key's direction in the index ( i.e. 1 or -1) using underscores as a separator. For example, an index created on `{ item : 1, quantity: -1 }` has the name `item_1_quantity_-1`.

You can create indexes with a custom name, such as one that is more human-readable than the default. For example, consider an application that frequently queries the products collection to populate data on existing inventory. The following `createIndex()` method creates an index on item and quantity named query for inventory:

```
db.products.createIndex(
    { item: 1, quantity: -1 },
    { name: "query for inventory" }
)
```

You can view index names using the `db.collection.getIndexes()` method. You cannot rename an index once created. Instead, you must drop and re-create the index with a new name.

## Index Types

MongoDB provides a number of different index types to support specific types of data and queries.

### Single Field

In addition to the MongoDB-defined `_id` index, MongoDB supports the creation of user-defined ascending/descending indexes on a **single field of a document**.

For a single-field index and sort operations, the sort order (i.e. ascending or descending) of the index key does not matter because MongoDB can traverse the index in either direction.
