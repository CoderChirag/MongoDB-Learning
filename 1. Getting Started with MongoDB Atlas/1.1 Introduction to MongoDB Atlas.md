## MongoDB Atlas

-   A Comprehensive Developer Data Platform
-   Database as a service (DBaaS) at its core
-   Provides an integrated suite of products and services that developers can use to build applications faster.
-   It helps you visualize, analyze, export, and build applications with your data.
