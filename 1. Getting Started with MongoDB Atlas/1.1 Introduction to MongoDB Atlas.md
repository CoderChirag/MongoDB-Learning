# Introduction to MongoDB Atlas, the Developer Data Platform

## MongoDB Atlas

-   A Comprehensive Developer Data Platform
-   Database as a service (DBaaS) at its core
-   Provides an integrated suite of products and services that developers can use to build applications faster.
-   It helps you visualize, analyze, export, and build applications with your data.

## Clusters

-   Atlas users can deploy clusters which are group of servers that store your data. These servers are configured in what we called a **Replica Set**.

## Replica Set

-   A few connected machines that store the same data to ensure that if something happens to one of the machines the data will remain intact.
-   When using Atlas, your database deployments have built-in replication referred to as **Replica Set**, meaning that your data is hold by a group of servers.
-   Ensures data redundancy and high availability, and that data will be available in the event of a server failure.
