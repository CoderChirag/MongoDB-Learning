# Create and Query a View

To create a view, use `db.createCollection()` or `db.createView()`.

## `db.createCollection()` Syntax

```
db.createCollection(
    "<viewName>",
    {
        "viewOn": "<source>",
        "pipeline": [<pipeline>],
        "collation": { <collation> }
    }
)
```

## `db.createView()` Syntax

```
db.createView(
    "<viewName>",
    "<source>",
    [<pipeline>],
    {
        "collation": { <collation> }
    }
)
```

## Restrictions

-   You must create views in the same database as the source collection.
-   A view definition pipeline cannot include the `$out` or the `$merge` stage. This restriction also applies to embedded pipelines, such as pipelines used in `$lookup` or `$facet` stages.
-   You cannot rename a view once it is created.

### Unsupported Operations

-   `db.collection.mapReduce()`.
-   `$text` operator, since `$text` operation in aggregation is valid only for the first stage.
-   `$geoNear` pipeline stage.
-   Renaming a view.

## Example

This example populates a collection with student data and creates a view to query the data.

### Populate the Collection

Create a `students` collection to use for this example:

```
db.students.insertMany([
    { sID: 22001, name: "Alex", year: 1, score: 4.0 },
    { sID: 21001, name: "bernie", year: 2, score: 3.7 },
    { sID: 20010, name: "Chris", year: 3, score: 2.5 },
    { sID: 22021, name: "Drew", year: 1, score: 3.2 },
    { sID: 17301, name: "harley", year: 6, score: 3.1 },
    { sID: 21022, name: "Farmer", year: 1, score: 2.2 },
    { sID: 20020, name: "george", year: 3, score: 2.8 },
    { sID: 18020, name: "Harley", year: 5, score: 2.8 },
])
```

### Use `db.createview()` to Create a View

Use `db.createView()` to create a view that is limited to first year students:

```
db.createView(
    "firstYears", // view name
    "students", // source collection
    [ { match: { year: 1 } } ] // pipeline
)
```

### Query the View

This example queries the view:

```
db.firstYears.find( {}, { _id: 0 } )
```

The following output only contains the documents with data on first year students. The `{ _id: 0 }` projection suppresses the `_id` field in the output.

```
[
  { sID: 22001, name: 'Alex', year: 1, score: 4 },
  { sID: 22021, name: 'Drew', year: 1, score: 3.2 },
  { sID: 21022, name: 'Farmer', year: 1, score: 2.2 }
]
```

#### Note - Projection Restrictions

`find()` operations on views do not support the following projection operators:

-   `$`
-   `$elemMatch`
-   `$slice`
-   `$meta`

### Use `db.createCollection()` to Create a View

The `db.createCollection()` method allows you to create a collection or a view with specific options.

The following example creates a `graduateStudents` view. The view only contains documents selected by the `$match` stage. The optional `collation` setting determines the sort order.

```
db.createCollection(
    "graduateStudents",
    {
        viewOn: "students",
        pipeline: [ { $match: { $expr: { $gt: [ "$year", 4 ] } } } ],
        collation: { locale: "en", caseFirst: "upper" }
    }
)
```

#### Note - Collation Behaviour

-   You can specify a default **collation** for a view at creation time. If no **collation** is specified, the view's default **collation** is the **`"simple"` binary comparison collator**. That is, the view does not inherit the collection's default collation.
-   String comparisons on the view use the view's default collation. An operation that attempts to change or override a view's default collation will fail with an error.
-   If creating a view from another view, you cannot specify a collation that differs from the source view's collation.
-   If performing an aggregation that involves multiple views, such as with `$lookup` or `$graphLookup`, the views must have the same collation.

## Behaviour

The following sections describe the behaviors of view creation and queries.

### Aggregation Optimizations

When you query a view:

-   Query `filter`, `projection`, `sort`, `skip`, `limit`, and other operations for `db.collection.find()` are converted to the equivalent aggregation pipeline stages.
-   MongoDB appends the client query to the underlying pipeline and returns the results of that combined pipeline to the client. MongoDB may apply aggregation pipeline optimizations to the combined pipeline.
-   The aggregation pipeline optimizer reshapes the view aggregation pipeline stages to improve performance. The optimization does not change the query results.

### Resource Locking

`db.createView()` obtains an exclusive lock on the specified collection or view for the duration of the operation. All subsequent operations on the collection must wait until `db.createView()` releases the lock. `db.createView()` typically holds this lock for a short time.

Creating a view requires obtaining an additional exclusive lock on the `system.views` collection in the database. This lock blocks creation or modification of views in the database until the command completes.

# Use a View to Join Two Collections

You can use `$lookup` to create a view over two collections and then run queries against the view. Applications can query the view without having to construct or maintain complex pipelines.

## Example

Create two sample collections, `inventory` and `orders`:

```
db.inventory.insertMany( [
   { prodId: 100, price: 20, quantity: 125 },
   { prodId: 101, price: 10, quantity: 234 },
   { prodId: 102, price: 15, quantity: 432 },
   { prodId: 103, price: 17, quantity: 320 }
] )

db.orders.insertMany( [
   { orderId: 201, custid: 301, prodId: 100, numPurchased: 20 },
   { orderId: 202, custid: 302, prodId: 101, numPurchased: 10 },
   { orderId: 203, custid: 303, prodId: 102, numPurchased: 5 },
   { orderId: 204, custid: 303, prodId: 103, numPurchased: 15 },
   { orderId: 205, custid: 303, prodId: 103, numPurchased: 20 },
   { orderId: 206, custid: 302, prodId: 102, numPurchased: 1 },
   { orderId: 207, custid: 302, prodId: 101, numPurchased: 5 },
   { orderId: 208, custid: 301, prodId: 100, numPurchased: 10 },
   { orderId: 209, custid: 303, prodId: 103, numPurchased: 30 }
] )
```

### Create a Joined View

This command uses `db.createView()` to create a new view named sales based on the orders collection:

```
db.createView( "sales", "orders", [
    {
        $lookup: {
            from: "inventory",
            localField: "prodId",
            foreignField: "prodId",
            as: "inventoryDocs"
        }
    },
    {
        $project: {
            _id: 0,
            prodId: 1,
            orderId: 1,
            numPurchased: 1,
            price: "$inventoryDocs.price"
        }
    },
    { $unwind: "price" } // Converts price field from array to a scalar value
] )
```

### Query the View

To find the total amount sold of each product, query the view:

```
db.sales.aggregate([
    {
        $group: {
            _id: "prodId",
            amountSold: { $sum: { $multiply: ["price", "numPurchased"] } }
        }
    }
])
```

The output is:

```
[
  { _id: 102, amountSold: 90 },
  { _id: 101, amountSold: 150 },
  { _id: 103, amountSold: 1105 },
  { _id: 100, amountSold: 600 }
]
```
