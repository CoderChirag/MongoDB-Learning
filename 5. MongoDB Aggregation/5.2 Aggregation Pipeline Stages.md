# Aggregation Pipeline Stages

In the `db.collection.aggregate()` method and `db.aggregate()` method, pipeline stages appear in an array. Documents pass through the stages in sequence.

## Stages

### `db.collection.aggregate()` Stages

All except the `$out`, `$merge`, `$geoNear`, and `$changeStream` stages can appear multiple times in a pipeline.

```
db.collection.aggregate([
    {
        $stage1: {
            { expression1 },
            { expression2 }...
        },
        $stage2: {
            { expression1 }...
        }
    }
])
```

| Stage              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `$addFields`       | Adds new fields to documents. Similar to `$project`, `$addFields` reshapes each document in the stream; specifically, by adding new fields to output documents that contain both the existing fields from the input documents and the newly added fields.<br>`$set` is an alias for `$addFields`.                                                                                                |
| `$bucket`          | Categorizes incoming documents into groups, called buckets, based on a specified expression and bucket boundaries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `$bucketAuto`      | Categorizes incoming documents into a specific number of groups, called buckets, based on a specified expression. Bucket boundaries are automatically determined in an attempt to evenly distribute the documents into the specified number of buckets.                                                                                                                                          |
| `$changeStream`    | Returns a **Change Stream** cursor for the collection.

| `$fill`            | Populates null and missing field values within documents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `$geoNear`         | Returns an ordered stream of documents based on the proximity to a geospatial point. Incorporates the functionality of `$match`, `$sort`, and `$limit` for geospatial data. The output documents include an additional distance field and can include a location identifier field.                                                                                                               |
| `$graphLookup`     | Performs a recursive search on a collection. To each output document, adds a new array field that contains the traversal results of the recursive search for that document.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| `$merge`           | Writes the resulting documents of the aggregation pipeline to a collection. The stage can incorporate (insert new documents, merge documents, replace documents, keep existing documents, fail the operation, process documents with a custom update pipeline) the results into an output collection. To use the $merge stage, it must be the last stage in the pipeline.<br>New in version 4.2. |
| `$out`             | Writes the resulting documents of the aggregation pipeline to a collection. To use the `$out` stage, it **must be the last stage** in the pipeline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| `$set`             | Adds new fields to documents. Similar to `$project`, `$set` reshapes each document in the stream; specifically, by adding new fields to output documents that contain both the existing fields from the input documents and the newly added fields.<br>`$set` is an alias for `$addFields` stage.                                                                                                |
| `$setWindowFields` | Groups documents into windows and applies one or more operators to the documents in each window.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `$skip`            | Skips the first `n` documents where `n` is the specified skip number and passes the remaining documents unmodified to the pipeline. For each input document, outputs either zero documents (for the first `n` documents) or one document (if after the first `n` documents).                                                                                                                     |
| `$sort`            | Reorders the document stream by a specified sort key.<br>Only the order changes; the documents remain unmodified. For each input document, outputs one document.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `$sortByCount`     | Groups incoming documents based on the value of a specified expression, then computes the count of documents in each distinct group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `$unionWith`       | Performs a union of two collections; i.e. combines pipeline results from two collections into a single result set.<br>New in version 4.4.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `$unset`           | Removes/excludes fields from documents.<br>`$unset` is an alias for `$project` stage that removes fields.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `$unwind`          | Deconstructs an array field from the input documents to output a document for each element. Each output document replaces the array with an element value. For each input document, outputs `n` documents where n is the number of array elements and can be zero for an empty array.                                                                                                            |

### `db.aggregate()` Stages

MongoDB also provides the `db.aggregate()` method:

```
db.aggregate( [ { <stage> }, ... ] )
```

The following stages use the `db.aggregate()` method and not the `db.collection.aggregate()` method.

| Stage                | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$changeStream`      | Returns a Change Stream cursor for the collection. This stage **can only occur once** in an aggregation pipeline and it **must occur as the first stage**.                    |
| `$currentOp`         | Returns information on active and/or dormant operations for the MongoDB deployment.                                                                                           |
| `$listLocalSessions` | Lists all active sessions recently in use on the currently connected mongos or mongod instance. These sessions may have not yet propagated to the system.sessions collection. |
| `$documents`         | Returns literal documents from input values.                                                                                                                                  |
