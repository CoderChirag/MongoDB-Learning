# MongoDB Aggregation

An analysis and summary of data.

## Aggregation Operations

Aggregation operations process multiple documents and return computed results. You can use aggregation operations to:

-   Group values from multiple documents together.
-   Perform operations on the grouped data to return a single result.
-   Analyze data changes over time.

To perform aggregation operations, you can use:

-   **Aggregation pipelines**, which are the preferred method for performing aggregations.
-   **Single purpose aggregation methods**, which are simple but lack the capabilities of an aggregation pipeline.
