# Single Field Indexes

MongoDB provides complete support for indexes on any field in a collection of documents. By default, all collections have an index on the `_id` field, and applications and users may add additional indexes to support important queries and operations.

This section describes ascending/descending indexes on a single field.

![single field indexes](assets/index-ascending.svg)

## Create an Ascending Index on a Single Field

Consider a collection named `records` that holds documents that resemble the following sample document:

```
{
  "_id": ObjectId("570c04a4ad233577f97dc459"),
  "score": 1034,
  "location": { state: "NY", city: "New York" }
}
```

The following operation creates an ascending index on the `score` field of the `records` collection:

```
db.records.createIndex( { score: 1 } )
```

The value of the field in the index specification describes the kind of index for that field. For example, a value of `1` specifies an index that orders items in **ascending** order. A value of `-1` specifies an index that orders items in **descending** order.

The created index will support queries that select on the field score, such as the following:

```
db.records.find( { score: 2 } )
db.records.find( { score: { $gt: 10 } } )
```

## Create an Index on an Embedded Field

You can create indexes on fields within embedded documents, just as you can index top-level fields in documents. Indexes on embedded fields differ from indexes on embedded documents, which include the full content up to the maximum index size of the embedded document in the index. Instead, indexes on embedded fields allow you to use a **"dot notation,"** to introspect into embedded documents.

Consider a collection named `records` that holds documents that resemble the following sample document:

```
{
  "_id": ObjectId("570c04a4ad233577f97dc459"),
  "score": 1034,
  "location": { state: "NY", city: "New York" }
}
```

The following operation creates an index on the `location.state` field:

```
db.records.createIndex( { "location.state": 1 } )
```

The created index will support queries that select on the field `location.state`, such as the following:

```
db.records.find( { "location.state": "CA" } )
db.records.find( { "location.city": "Albany", "location.state": "NY" } )
```

## Create an Index on Embedded Document

You can also create indexes on embedded document as a whole.

Consider a collection named `records` that holds documents that resemble the following sample document:

```
{
  "_id": ObjectId("570c04a4ad233577f97dc459"),
  "score": 1034,
  "location": { state: "NY", city: "New York" }
}
```

The `location` field is an **embedded document**, containing the embedded fields city and state. The following command creates an index on the `location` field as a whole:

```
db.records.createIndex( { location: 1 } )
```

The following query can use the index on the `location` field:

```
db.records.find( { location: { city: "New York", state: "NY" } } )
```

**Note :** Although the query can use the index, the **result set does not include the sample document above**. When performing equality matches on embedded documents, **field order matters** and the embedded documents must match exactly.

# Compund Indexes

MongoDB supports compound indexes, where a single index structure holds references to multiple fields (MongoDB imposes a limit of 32 fields for any compound index) within a collection's documents. The following diagram illustrates an example of a compound index on two fields:

![compund indexes](assets/index-compound-key.svg)
Compound indexes can support queries that match on multiple fields.

## Create a Compound Index

To create a compound index use an operation that resembles the following prototype:

```
db.collection.createIndex( { <field1>: <type>, <field2>: <type2>, ... } )
```

The value of the field in the index specification describes the kind of index for that field. For example, a value of `1` specifies an index that orders items in **ascending** order. A value of `-1` specifies an index that orders items in **descending** order.

The order of the indexed fields has a strong impact on the effectiveness of a particular index for a given query. For most compound indexes, following the **ESR (Equality, Sort, Range) rule** helps to create efficient indexes.

### Important

Starting in MongoDB 4.4:

-   **Compound indexes** may contain **a single** [hashed index field](#hashed-indexes).
-   You will receive an error if you attempt to create a compound index that contains more than one [hashed index field](#hashed-indexes).

In MongoDB 4.2 or earlier:

-   **Compound indexes** may **not** contain a [hashed index field](#hashed-indexes).
-   You will receive an error if you attempt to create a compound index that contains a [hashed index field](#hashed-indexes).

Consider a collection named `products` that holds documents that resemble the following document:

```
{
 "_id": ObjectId(...),
 "item": "Banana",
 "category": ["food", "produce", "grocery"],
 "location": "4th Street Store",
 "stock": 4,
 "type": "cases"
}
```

The following operation creates an ascending index on the `item` and `stock` fields:

```
db.products.createIndex( { "item": 1, "stock": 1 } )
```

**The order of the fields listed in a compound index is important.** The index will contain references to documents sorted first by the values of the `item` field and, within each value of the `item` field, sorted by values of the `stock` field.

In addition to supporting queries that match on all the index fields, compound indexes can support queries that match on the **prefix** of the index fields. That is, the index supports queries on the `item` field as well as both `item` and `stock` fields:

```
db.products.find( { item: "Banana" } )
db.products.find( { item: "Banana", stock: { $gt: 5 } } )
```

## Sort Order

Indexes store references to fields in either ascending (`1`) or descending (`-1`) sort order. For single-field indexes, the sort order of keys doesn't matter because MongoDB can traverse the index in either direction. However, for compound indexes, sort order can matter in determining whether the index can support a sort operation.

Consider a collection events that contains documents with the fields `username` and `date`. Applications can issue queries that return results sorted first by **ascending** `username` values and then by **descending** (i.e. more recent to last) `date` values, such as:

```
db.events.find().sort( { username: 1, date: -1 } )
```

or queries that return results sorted first by **descending** `username` values and then by **ascending** `date` values, such as:

```
db.events.find().sort( { username: -1, date: 1 } )
```

The following index can support both these sort operations:

```
db.events.createIndex( { "username" : 1, "date" : -1 } )
```

However, the above index cannot support sorting by **ascending** `username` values and then by **ascending** `date` values, such as the following:

```
db.events.find().sort( { username: 1, date: 1 } )
```

## Prefixes

Index prefixes are the beginning subsets of indexed fields. For example, consider the following compound index:

```
{ "item": 1, "location": 1, "stock": 1 }
```

The index has the following index prefixes:

-   `{ item: 1 }`
-   `{ item: 1, location: 1 }`

For a compound index, MongoDB can use the index to support queries on the index prefixes. As such, MongoDB can use the index for queries on the following fields:

-   the `item` field,
-   the `item` field and the `location` field,
-   the `item` field and the `location` field and the `stock` field.

MongoDB can also use the index to support a query on the `item` and `stock` fields, since the `item` field corresponds to a prefix. However, in this case the index **would not be as efficient** in supporting the query as it would be if the index were on only `item`. Index fields are parsed in order; if a query omits a particular index prefix, it is unable to make use of any index fields that follow that prefix.

Since a query on `item` and `stock` omits the `location` index prefix, it cannot use the `stock` index field which follows `location`. Only the `item` field in the index can support this query.

MongoDB cannot use the index to support queries that include the following fields since without the `item` field, none of the listed fields correspond to a prefix index:

-   the `location` field,
-   the `stock` field, or
-   the `location` and `stock` fields.

If you have a collection that has both a compound index and an index on its prefix (e.g. `{ a: 1, b: 1 }` and `{ a: 1 }`), if neither index has a sparse or unique constraint, then you can remove the index on the prefix (e.g. `{ a: 1 }`). MongoDB will use the compound index in all of the situations that it would have used the prefix index.

# Multikey Indexes

To index a field that holds an array value, MongoDB creates an index key for each element in the array. These multikey indexes support efficient queries against array fields. Multikey indexes can be constructed over arrays that hold both scalar values (A scalar value refers to value that is neither an embedded document nor an array.) (e.g. strings, numbers) and nested documents.

![multikey indexes](assets/index-multikey.svg)

## Create Multikey Index

To create a multikey index, use the `db.collection.createIndex()` method:

```
db.coll.createIndex( { <field>: < 1 or -1 > } )
```

MongoDB automatically creates a multikey index if any indexed field is an array; you do not need to explicitly specify the multikey type.

## Multikey Index Bounds

If an index is multikey, then computation of the index bounds follows special rules.

The bounds of an index scan define the portions of an index to search during a query. When multiple predicates over an index exist, MongoDB will attempt to combine the bounds for these predicates, by either intersection or compounding, in order to produce a scan with smaller bounds.

### Intersect Bounds for Multikey Index

Bounds intersection refers to a logical conjunction (i.e. `AND`) of multiple bounds. For instance, given two bounds `[ [ 3, Infinity ] ]` and `[ [ -Infinity, 6 ] ]`, the intersection of the bounds results in `[ [ 3, 6 ] ]`.

Given an indexed array field, consider a query that specifies multiple predicates on the array and can use a multikey index. MongoDB can intersect multikey index bounds if an `$elemMatch` joins the predicates.

For example, create a survey `collection` that contains documents with a field `item` and an array field `ratings`:

```
db.survey.insertMany(
   [
      { _id: 1, item: "ABC", ratings: [ 2, 9 ] },
      { _id: 2, item: "XYZ", ratings: [ 4, 3 ] }
   ]
)
```

Create a multikey index on the `ratings` array:

```
db.survey.createIndex( { ratings: 1 } )
```

The following query uses `$elemMatch` to require that the array contains **at least one single element that matches both conditions**:

```
db.survey.find( { ratings : { $elemMatch: { $gte: 3, $lte: 6 } } } )
```

Taking the predicates separately:

-   the bounds for the greater than or equal to 3 predicate (i.e. `$gte: 3`) are `[ [ 3, Infinity ] ]`;
-   the bounds for the less than or equal to 6 predicate (i.e. `$lte: 6`) are `[ [ -Infinity, 6 ] ]`.

Because the query uses `$elemMatch` to join these predicates, MongoDB can intersect the bounds to:

```
ratings: [ [ 3, 6 ] ]
```

If the query does not join the conditions on the array field with `$elemMatch`, MongoDB cannot intersect the multikey index bounds. Consider the following query:

```
db.survey.find( { ratings : { $gte: 3, $lte: 6 } } )
```

The query searches the ratings array for **at least one element greater than or equal to 3 and at least one element less than or equal to 6**. Because a single element does not need to meet both criteria, MongoDB does not intersect the bounds and uses either `[ [ 3, Infinity ] ]` or `[ [ -Infinity, 6 ] ]`. MongoDB makes no guarantee as to which of these two bounds it chooses.

### Compound Bounds for Multikey Index

Compounding bounds refers to using bounds for multiple keys of compound index. For instance, given a compound index `{ a: 1, b: 1 }` with bounds on field `a` of `[ [ 3, Infinity ] ]` and bounds on field `b` of `[ [ -Infinity, 6 ] ]`, compounding the bounds results in the use of both bounds:

-   `{ a: [ [ 3, Infinity ] ], b: [ [ -Infinity, 6 ] ] }`

If MongoDB cannot compound the two bounds, MongoDB always constrains the index scan by the bound on its leading field, in this case, `a: [ [ 3, Infinity ] ]`.

### Compund Index on an Array Field

Consider a compound multikey index; i.e. a compound index where one of the indexed fields is an array. For example, create a survey collection that contains documents with a field `item` and an array field `ratings`:

```
db.survey.insertMany(
   [
      { _id: 1, item: "ABC", ratings: [ 2, 9 ] },
      { _id: 2, item: "XYZ", ratings: [ 4, 3 ] }
   ]
)
```

Create a compound index on the `item` field and the `ratings` field:

```
db.survey.createIndex( { item: 1, ratings: 1 } )
```

The following query specifies a condition on both keys of the index:

```
db.survey.find( { item: "XYZ", ratings: { $gte: 3 } } )
```

Taking the predicates separately:

-   the bounds for the `item: "XYZ"` predicate are `[ [ "XYZ", "XYZ" ] ]`;
-   the bounds for the ratings: `{ $gte: 3 }` predicate are `[ [ 3, Infinity ] ]`.

MongoDB can compound the two bounds to use the combined bounds of:

```
{ item: [ [ "XYZ", "XYZ" ] ], ratings: [ [ 3, Infinity ] ] }
```

## Unique Multikey Index

For unique indexes, the `unique` constraint **applies across separate documents in the collection** rather than within a single document.

Because the unique constraint applies to separate documents, for a unique multikey index, a document may have array elements that result in repeating index key values as long as the index key values for that document do not duplicate those of another document.

## Limitations

### Compund Multikey Indexes

For a compound multikey index, each indexed document can have at most one indexed field whose value is an array. That is:

-   You cannot create a compound multikey index if more than one to-be-indexed field of a document is an array. For example, consider a collection that contains the following document:

    ```
    { _id: 1, a: [ 1, 2 ], b: [ 1, 2 ], category: "AB - both arrays" }
    ```

    You cannot create a compound multikey index `{ a: 1, b: 1 }` on the collection since both the `a` and `b` fields are arrays.

-   Or, if a compound multikey index already exists, you cannot insert a document that would violate this restriction.
    Consider a collection that contains the following documents:
    `   { _id: 1, a: [1, 2], b: 1, category: "A array" }
{ _id: 2, a: 1, b: [1, 2], category: "B array" }`
    A compound multikey index `{ a: 1, b: 1 }` is permissible since for each document, only one field indexed by the compound multikey index is an array; i.e. no document contains array values for both `a` and `b` fields.
    <br>
    However, after creating the compound multikey index, if you attempt to insert a document where both `a` and `b` fields are arrays, MongoDB will fail the insert.

If a field is an array of documents, you can index the embedded fields to create a compound index. For example, consider a collection that contains the following documents:

```
{ _id: 1, a: [ { x: 5, z: [ 1, 2 ] }, { z: [ 1, 2 ] } ] }
{ _id: 2, a: [ { x: 5 }, { z: 4 } ] }
```

You can create a compound index on `{ "a.x": 1, "a.z": 1 }`. The restriction where at most one indexed field can be an array also applies.

## Query on the Array Field as a Whole

When a query filter specifies an exact match for an array as a whole, MongoDB **can use the multikey index to look up the first element of the query array but cannot use the multikey index scan to find the whole array.** Instead, after using the multikey index to look up the first element of the query array, MongoDB retrieves the associated documents and filters for documents whose array matches the array in the query.

For example, consider an inventory `collection` that contains the following documents:

```
{ _id: 5, type: "food", item: "aaa", ratings: [ 5, 8, 9 ] }
{ _id: 6, type: "food", item: "bbb", ratings: [ 5, 9 ] }
{ _id: 7, type: "food", item: "ccc", ratings: [ 9, 5, 8 ] }
{ _id: 8, type: "food", item: "ddd", ratings: [ 9, 5 ] }
{ _id: 9, type: "food", item: "eee", ratings: [ 5, 9, 5 ] }
```

The collection has a multikey index on the `ratings` field:

```
db.inventory.createIndex( { ratings: 1 } )
```

The following query looks for documents where the `ratings` field is the array `[ 5, 9 ]`:

```
db.inventory.find( { ratings: [ 5, 9 ] } )
```

MongoDB can use the multikey index to find documents that have `5` at any position in the `ratings` array. Then, MongoDB retrieves these documents and filters for documents whose ratings array equals the query array `[ 5, 9 ]`.

## `$expr`

`$expr` does not support multikey indexes.

## Examples

### Index Basic Arrays

Create a `survey` collection with the following document:

```
db.survey.insertOne(
   { _id: 1, item: "ABC", ratings: [ 2, 5, 9 ] }
)
```

Create an index on the field `ratings`:

```
db.survey.createIndex( { ratings: 1 } )
```

Since the `ratings` field contains an array, the index on `ratings` is multikey. The multikey index contains the following three index keys, each pointing to the same document:

-   `2`,
-   `5`, and
-   `9`.

### Index Arrays with Embedded Documents

You can create multikey indexes on array fields that contain nested objects.

Consider an `inventory` collection with documents of the following form:

```
{
  _id: 1,
  item: "abc",
  stock: [
    { size: "S", color: "red", quantity: 25 },
    { size: "S", color: "blue", quantity: 10 },
    { size: "M", color: "blue", quantity: 50 }
  ]
}
{
  _id: 2,
  item: "def",
  stock: [
    { size: "S", color: "blue", quantity: 20 },
    { size: "M", color: "blue", quantity: 5 },
    { size: "M", color: "black", quantity: 10 },
    { size: "L", color: "red", quantity: 2 }
  ]
}
{
  _id: 3,
  item: "ijk",
  stock: [
    { size: "M", color: "blue", quantity: 15 },
    { size: "L", color: "blue", quantity: 100 },
    { size: "L", color: "red", quantity: 25 }
  ]
}
...
```

The following operation creates a multikey index on the `stock.size` and `stock.quantity` fields:

```
db.inventory.createIndex( { "stock.size": 1, "stock.quantity": 1 } )
```

The compound multikey index can support queries with predicates that include both indexed fields as well as predicates that include only the index prefix `"stock.size"`, as in the following examples:

```
db.inventory.find( { "stock.size": "M" } )
db.inventory.find( { "stock.size": "S", "stock.quantity": { $gt: 20 } } )
```

For details on how MongoDB can combine multikey index bounds, see [Multikey Index Bounds](#multikey-index-bounds).

The compound multikey index can also support sort operations, such as the following examples:

```
db.inventory.find( ).sort( { "stock.size": 1, "stock.quantity": 1 } )
db.inventory.find( { "stock.size": "M" } ).sort( { "stock.quantity": 1 } )
```

# Wildcard Indexes

MongoDB supports creating indexes on a field or set of fields to support queries. Since MongoDB supports dynamic schemas, applications can query against fields whose names cannot be known in advance or are arbitrary.

New in version MongoDB: 4.2

MongoDB 4.2 introduces wildcard indexes for supporting queries against unknown or arbitrary fields.

Consider an application that captures user-defined data under the `userMetadata` field and supports querying against that data:

```
{ "userMetadata" : { "likes" : [ "dogs", "cats" ] } }
{ "userMetadata" : { "dislikes" : "pickles" } }
{ "userMetadata" : { "age" : 45 } }
{ "userMetadata" : "inactive" }
```

Administrators want to create indexes to support queries on any subfield of `userMetadata`.

A wildcard index on `userMetadata` can support single-field queries on `userMetadata`, `userMetadata.likes`, `userMetadata.dislikes`, and `userMetadata.age`:

```
db.userData.createIndex( { "userMetadata.$**" : 1 } )
```

The index can support the following queries:

```
db.userData.find({ "userMetadata.likes" : "dogs" })
db.userData.find({ "userMetadata.dislikes" : "pickles" })
db.userData.find({ "userMetadata.age" : { $gt : 30 } })
db.userData.find({ "userMetadata" : "inactive" })
```

## Create a Wildcard Index on a Field

To index the value of a specific field:

```
db.collection.createIndex( { "fieldA.$**" : 1 } )
```

With this wildcard index, MongoDB indexes all values of `fieldA`. If the field is a nested document or array, the wildcard index **recurses** into the document/array and stores the value for all fields in the document/array.

For example, documents in the `product_catalog` collection may contain a `product_attributes field`. The `product_attributes` field can contain arbitrary nested fields, including embedded documents and arrays:

```
{
  "product_name" : "Spy Coat",
  "product_attributes" : {
    "material" : [ "Tweed", "Wool", "Leather" ]
    "size" : {
      "length" : 72,
      "units" : "inches"
    }
  }
}
{
  "product_name" : "Spy Pen",
  "product_attributes" : {
     "colors" : [ "Blue", "Black" ],
     "secret_feature" : {
       "name" : "laser",
       "power" : "1000",
       "units" : "watts",
     }
  }
}
```

The following operation creates a wildcard index on the `product_attributes` field:

```
db.products_catalog.createIndex( { "product_attributes.$**" : 1 } )
```

The wildcard index can support arbitrary single-field queries on `product_attributes` or its embedded fields:

```
db.products_catalog.find( { "product_attributes.size.length" : { $gt : 60 } } )
db.products_catalog.find( { "product_attributes.material" : "Leather" } )
db.products_catalog.find( { "product_attributes.secret_feature.name" : "laser" }
```

## Create a Wildcard Index on All Fields

```
db.collection.createIndex( { "$**" : 1 } )
```

## Create a Wildcard Index on Multiple Specific Fields

To index the values of multiple specific fields in a document:

```
db.collection.createIndex(
  { "$**" : 1 },
  { "wildcardProjection" :
    { "fieldA" : 1, "fieldB.fieldC" : 1 }
  }
)
```

With this wildcard index, MongoDB indexes all values for the specified fields for each document in the collection. If a given field is a nested document or array, the wildcard index recurses into the document/array and stores the value for all fields in the document/array.

## Create a Wildcard Index that Excludes Multiple Specific Fields

To index the fields of all fields in a document excluding specific field paths:

```
db.collection.createIndex(
  { "$**" : 1 },
  { "wildcardProjection" :
    { "fieldA" : 0, "fieldB.fieldC" : 0 }
  }
)
```

With this wildcard index, MongoDB indexes all fields for each document in the collection excluding the specified field paths. If a given field is a nested document or array, the wildcard index recurses into the document/array and stores the values for all fields in the document/array.

## Restrictions

-   You cannot shard a collection using a wildcard index. Create a non-wildcard index on the field or fields you want to shard on. For more information on shard key selection, see Shard Keys.
-   You cannot create a compound index.
-   You cannot specify the following properties for a wildcard index:
    -   TTL
    -   Unique
-   You cannot create the following index types using wildcard syntax:
    -   2d (Geospatial)
    -   2dsphere (Geospatial)
    -   Hashed

# Hashed Indexes

**Hashed indexes** maintain entries with hashes of the values of the indexed field.

Hashed indexes support **sharding** using hashed shard keys. **Hashed based sharding** uses a hashed index of a field as the shard key to partition data across your sharded cluster.

Using a hashed shard key to shard a collection results in a more even distribution of data.

## Hashing Function

Hashed indexes use a hashing function to compute the hash of the value of the index field. (Starting in version 4.0, `mongosh` provides the method `convertShardKeyToHashed()`. This method uses the same hashing function as the hashed index and can be used to see what the hashed value would be for a key.)

The hashing function collapses embedded documents and computes the hash for the entire value but **does not support multi-key (i.e. arrays) indexes**. Specifically, creating a hashed index on a field that contains an array or attempting to insert an array into a hashed indexed field returns an error.

## Create a Hashed Index

To create a **hashed index**, specify hashed as the value of the index key, as in the following example:

```
db.collection.createIndex( { _id: "hashed" } )
```

## Create a Compound Hashed Index

New in version 4.4.

Starting with MongoDB 4.4, MongoDB supports creating compound indexes that include a single hashed field. To create a compound hashed index, specify hashed as the value of any single index key when creating the index:

```
db.collection.createIndex( { "fieldA" : 1, "fieldB" : "hashed", "fieldC" : -1 } )
```

## Considerations

### Embedded Documents

The hashing function collapses embedded documents and computes the hash for the entire value, but does not support multi-key (i.e. arrays) indexes. Specifically, creating a hashed index on a field that contains an array or attempting to insert an array to a hashed indexed field returns an error.

### Unique Constraint

MongoDB does not support specifying a unique constraint on a hashed index. You can instead create an additional non-hashed index with the unique constraint on that field. MongoDB can use that non-hashed index for enforcing uniqueness on the field

# Additional Index Types

There are several more index types which you can study in detail from mongodb docs. These includes:

-   **Text Indexes**
-   **2dsphere Indexes**
-   **2d Indexes**
-   **geoHaystack Indexes**
