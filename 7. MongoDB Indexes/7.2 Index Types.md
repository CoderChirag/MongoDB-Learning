# Single Field Indexes

MongoDB provides complete support for indexes on any field in a collection of documents. By default, all collections have an index on the `_id` field, and applications and users may add additional indexes to support important queries and operations.

This section describes ascending/descending indexes on a single field.

## Create an Ascending Index on a Single Field

Consider a collection named `records` that holds documents that resemble the following sample document:

```
{
  "_id": ObjectId("570c04a4ad233577f97dc459"),
  "score": 1034,
  "location": { state: "NY", city: "New York" }
}
```

The following operation creates an ascending index on the `score` field of the `records` collection:

```
db.records.createIndex( { score: 1 } )
```

The value of the field in the index specification describes the kind of index for that field. For example, a value of `1` specifies an index that orders items in **ascending** order. A value of `-1` specifies an index that orders items in **descending** order.

The created index will support queries that select on the field score, such as the following:

```
db.records.find( { score: 2 } )
db.records.find( { score: { $gt: 10 } } )
```

## Create an Index on an Embedded Field

You can create indexes on fields within embedded documents, just as you can index top-level fields in documents. Indexes on embedded fields differ from indexes on embedded documents, which include the full content up to the maximum index size of the embedded document in the index. Instead, indexes on embedded fields allow you to use a **"dot notation,"** to introspect into embedded documents.

Consider a collection named `records` that holds documents that resemble the following sample document:

```
{
  "_id": ObjectId("570c04a4ad233577f97dc459"),
  "score": 1034,
  "location": { state: "NY", city: "New York" }
}
```

The following operation creates an index on the `location.state` field:

```
db.records.createIndex( { "location.state": 1 } )
```

The created index will support queries that select on the field `location.state`, such as the following:

```
db.records.find( { "location.state": "CA" } )
db.records.find( { "location.city": "Albany", "location.state": "NY" } )
```

## Create an Index on Embedded Document

You can also create indexes on embedded document as a whole.

Consider a collection named `records` that holds documents that resemble the following sample document:

```
{
  "_id": ObjectId("570c04a4ad233577f97dc459"),
  "score": 1034,
  "location": { state: "NY", city: "New York" }
}
```

The `location` field is an **embedded document**, containing the embedded fields city and state. The following command creates an index on the `location` field as a whole:

```
db.records.createIndex( { location: 1 } )
```

The following query can use the index on the `location` field:

```
db.records.find( { location: { city: "New York", state: "NY" } } )
```

**Note :** Although the query can use the index, the result set does not include the sample document above. When performing equality matches on embedded documents, field order matters and the embedded documents must match exactly.
