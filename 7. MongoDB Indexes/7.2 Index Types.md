# Single Field Indexes

MongoDB provides complete support for indexes on any field in a collection of documents. By default, all collections have an index on the `_id` field, and applications and users may add additional indexes to support important queries and operations.

This section describes ascending/descending indexes on a single field.

![single field indexes](assets/index-ascending.svg)

## Create an Ascending Index on a Single Field

Consider a collection named `records` that holds documents that resemble the following sample document:

```
{
  "_id": ObjectId("570c04a4ad233577f97dc459"),
  "score": 1034,
  "location": { state: "NY", city: "New York" }
}
```

The following operation creates an ascending index on the `score` field of the `records` collection:

```
db.records.createIndex( { score: 1 } )
```

The value of the field in the index specification describes the kind of index for that field. For example, a value of `1` specifies an index that orders items in **ascending** order. A value of `-1` specifies an index that orders items in **descending** order.

The created index will support queries that select on the field score, such as the following:

```
db.records.find( { score: 2 } )
db.records.find( { score: { $gt: 10 } } )
```

## Create an Index on an Embedded Field

You can create indexes on fields within embedded documents, just as you can index top-level fields in documents. Indexes on embedded fields differ from indexes on embedded documents, which include the full content up to the maximum index size of the embedded document in the index. Instead, indexes on embedded fields allow you to use a **"dot notation,"** to introspect into embedded documents.

Consider a collection named `records` that holds documents that resemble the following sample document:

```
{
  "_id": ObjectId("570c04a4ad233577f97dc459"),
  "score": 1034,
  "location": { state: "NY", city: "New York" }
}
```

The following operation creates an index on the `location.state` field:

```
db.records.createIndex( { "location.state": 1 } )
```

The created index will support queries that select on the field `location.state`, such as the following:

```
db.records.find( { "location.state": "CA" } )
db.records.find( { "location.city": "Albany", "location.state": "NY" } )
```

## Create an Index on Embedded Document

You can also create indexes on embedded document as a whole.

Consider a collection named `records` that holds documents that resemble the following sample document:

```
{
  "_id": ObjectId("570c04a4ad233577f97dc459"),
  "score": 1034,
  "location": { state: "NY", city: "New York" }
}
```

The `location` field is an **embedded document**, containing the embedded fields city and state. The following command creates an index on the `location` field as a whole:

```
db.records.createIndex( { location: 1 } )
```

The following query can use the index on the `location` field:

```
db.records.find( { location: { city: "New York", state: "NY" } } )
```

**Note :** Although the query can use the index, the result set does not include the sample document above. When performing equality matches on embedded documents, field order matters and the embedded documents must match exactly.

# Compund Indexes

MongoDB supports compound indexes, where a single index structure holds references to multiple fields (MongoDB imposes a limit of 32 fields for any compound index) within a collection's documents. The following diagram illustrates an example of a compound index on two fields:

![compund indexes](assets/index-compound-key.svg)
Compound indexes can support queries that match on multiple fields.

## Create a Compound Index

To create a compound index use an operation that resembles the following prototype:

```
db.collection.createIndex( { <field1>: <type>, <field2>: <type2>, ... } )
```

The value of the field in the index specification describes the kind of index for that field. For example, a value of `1` specifies an index that orders items in **ascending** order. A value of `-1` specifies an index that orders items in **descending** order.

The order of the indexed fields has a strong impact on the effectiveness of a particular index for a given query. For most compound indexes, following the **ESR (Equality, Sort, Range) rule** helps to create efficient indexes.

Consider a collection named `products` that holds documents that resemble the following document:

```
{
 "_id": ObjectId(...),
 "item": "Banana",
 "category": ["food", "produce", "grocery"],
 "location": "4th Street Store",
 "stock": 4,
 "type": "cases"
}
```

The following operation creates an ascending index on the `item` and `stock` fields:

```
db.products.createIndex( { "item": 1, "stock": 1 } )
```

**The order of the fields listed in a compound index is important.** The index will contain references to documents sorted first by the values of the `item` field and, within each value of the `item` field, sorted by values of the `stock` field.

In addition to supporting queries that match on all the index fields, compound indexes can support queries that match on the **prefix** of the index fields. That is, the index supports queries on the `item` field as well as both `item` and `stock` fields:

```
db.products.find( { item: "Banana" } )
db.products.find( { item: "Banana", stock: { $gt: 5 } } )
```

## Sort Order

Indexes store references to fields in either ascending (`1`) or descending (`-1`) sort order. For single-field indexes, the sort order of keys doesn't matter because MongoDB can traverse the index in either direction. However, for compound indexes, sort order can matter in determining whether the index can support a sort operation.

Consider a collection events that contains documents with the fields `username` and `date`. Applications can issue queries that return results sorted first by **ascending** `username` values and then by **descending** (i.e. more recent to last) `date` values, such as:

```
db.events.find().sort( { username: 1, date: -1 } )
```

or queries that return results sorted first by **descending** `username` values and then by **ascending** `date` values, such as:

```
db.events.find().sort( { username: -1, date: 1 } )
```

The following index can support both these sort operations:

```
db.events.createIndex( { "username" : 1, "date" : -1 } )
```

However, the above index cannot support sorting by **ascending** `username` values and then by **ascending** `date` values, such as the following:

```
db.events.find().sort( { username: 1, date: 1 } )
```

## Prefixes

Index prefixes are the beginning subsets of indexed fields. For example, consider the following compound index:

```
{ "item": 1, "location": 1, "stock": 1 }
```

The index has the following index prefixes:

-   `{ item: 1 }`
-   `{ item: 1, location: 1 }`

For a compound index, MongoDB can use the index to support queries on the index prefixes. As such, MongoDB can use the index for queries on the following fields:

-   the `item` field,
-   the `item` field and the `location` field,
-   the `item` field and the `location` field and the `stock` field.

MongoDB can also use the index to support a query on the `item` and `stock` fields, since the `item` field corresponds to a prefix. However, in this case the index **would not be as efficient** in supporting the query as it would be if the index were on only `item`. Index fields are parsed in order; if a query omits a particular index prefix, it is unable to make use of any index fields that follow that prefix.

Since a query on `item` and `stock` omits the `location` index prefix, it cannot use the `stock` index field which follows `location`. Only the `item` field in the index can support this query.

MongoDB cannot use the index to support queries that include the following fields since without the `item` field, none of the listed fields correspond to a prefix index:

-   the `location` field,
-   the `stock` field, or
-   the `location` and `stock` fields.

If you have a collection that has both a compound index and an index on its prefix (e.g. `{ a: 1, b: 1 }` and `{ a: 1 }`), if neither index has a sparse or unique constraint, then you can remove the index on the prefix (e.g. `{ a: 1 }`). MongoDB will use the compound index in all of the situations that it would have used the prefix index.

# Multikey Indexes

To index a field that holds an array value, MongoDB creates an index key for each element in the array. These multikey indexes support efficient queries against array fields. Multikey indexes can be constructed over arrays that hold both scalar values (A scalar value refers to value that is neither an embedded document nor an array.) (e.g. strings, numbers) and nested documents.

![multikey indexes](assets/index-multikey.svg)

## Create Multikey Index

To create a multikey index, use the `db.collection.createIndex()` method:

```
db.coll.createIndex( { <field>: < 1 or -1 > } )
```

MongoDB automatically creates a multikey index if any indexed field is an array; you do not need to explicitly specify the multikey type.

## Multikey Index Bounds

If an index is multikey, then computation of the index bounds follows special rules.

The bounds of an index scan define the portions of an index to search during a query. When multiple predicates over an index exist, MongoDB will attempt to combine the bounds for these predicates, by either intersection or compounding, in order to produce a scan with smaller bounds.

### Intersect Bounds for Multikey Index

Bounds intersection refers to a logical conjunction (i.e. `AND`) of multiple bounds. For instance, given two bounds `[ [ 3, Infinity ] ]` and `[ [ -Infinity, 6 ] ]`, the intersection of the bounds results in `[ [ 3, 6 ] ]`.

Given an indexed array field, consider a query that specifies multiple predicates on the array and can use a multikey index. MongoDB can intersect multikey index bounds if an `$elemMatch` joins the predicates.

For example, create a survey `collection` that contains documents with a field `item` and an array field `ratings`:

```
db.survey.insertMany(
   [
      { _id: 1, item: "ABC", ratings: [ 2, 9 ] },
      { _id: 2, item: "XYZ", ratings: [ 4, 3 ] }
   ]
)
```

Create a multikey index on the `ratings` array:

```
db.survey.createIndex( { ratings: 1 } )
```

The following query uses `$elemMatch` to require that the array contains **at least one single element that matches both conditions**:

```
db.survey.find( { ratings : { $elemMatch: { $gte: 3, $lte: 6 } } } )
```

Taking the predicates separately:

-   the bounds for the greater than or equal to 3 predicate (i.e. `$gte: 3`) are `[ [ 3, Infinity ] ]`;
-   the bounds for the less than or equal to 6 predicate (i.e. `$lte: 6`) are `[ [ -Infinity, 6 ] ]`.

Because the query uses `$elemMatch` to join these predicates, MongoDB can intersect the bounds to:

```
ratings: [ [ 3, 6 ] ]
```

If the query does not join the conditions on the array field with `$elemMatch`, MongoDB cannot intersect the multikey index bounds. Consider the following query:

```
db.survey.find( { ratings : { $gte: 3, $lte: 6 } } )
```

The query searches the ratings array for **at least one element greater than or equal to 3 and at least one element less than or equal to 6**. Because a single element does not need to meet both criteria, MongoDB does not intersect the bounds and uses either `[ [ 3, Infinity ] ]` or `[ [ -Infinity, 6 ] ]`. MongoDB makes no guarantee as to which of these two bounds it chooses.

### Compound Bounds for Multikey Index

Compounding bounds refers to using bounds for multiple keys of compound index. For instance, given a compound index `{ a: 1, b: 1 }` with bounds on field `a` of `[ [ 3, Infinity ] ]` and bounds on field `b` of `[ [ -Infinity, 6 ] ]`, compounding the bounds results in the use of both bounds:

-   `{ a: [ [ 3, Infinity ] ], b: [ [ -Infinity, 6 ] ] }`

If MongoDB cannot compound the two bounds, MongoDB always constrains the index scan by the bound on its leading field, in this case, `a: [ [ 3, Infinity ] ]`.

### Compund Index on an Array Field

Consider a compound multikey index; i.e. a compound index where one of the indexed fields is an array. For example, create a survey collection that contains documents with a field `item` and an array field `ratings`:

```
db.survey.insertMany(
   [
      { _id: 1, item: "ABC", ratings: [ 2, 9 ] },
      { _id: 2, item: "XYZ", ratings: [ 4, 3 ] }
   ]
)
```

Create a compound index on the `item` field and the `ratings` field:

```
db.survey.createIndex( { item: 1, ratings: 1 } )
```

The following query specifies a condition on both keys of the index:

```
db.survey.find( { item: "XYZ", ratings: { $gte: 3 } } )
```

Taking the predicates separately:

-   the bounds for the `item: "XYZ"` predicate are `[ [ "XYZ", "XYZ" ] ]`;
-   the bounds for the ratings: `{ $gte: 3 }` predicate are `[ [ 3, Infinity ] ]`.

MongoDB can compound the two bounds to use the combined bounds of:

```
{ item: [ [ "XYZ", "XYZ" ] ], ratings: [ [ 3, Infinity ] ] }
```

## Unique Multikey Index

For unique indexes, the `unique` constraint **applies across separate documents in the collection** rather than within a single document.

Because the unique constraint applies to separate documents, for a unique multikey index, a document may have array elements that result in repeating index key values as long as the index key values for that document do not duplicate those of another document.

## Query on the Array Field as a Whole

When a query filter specifies an exact match for an array as a whole, MongoDB **can use the multikey index to look up the first element of the query array but cannot use the multikey index scan to find the whole array.** Instead, after using the multikey index to look up the first element of the query array, MongoDB retrieves the associated documents and filters for documents whose array matches the array in the query.

For example, consider an inventory `collection` that contains the following documents:

```
{ _id: 5, type: "food", item: "aaa", ratings: [ 5, 8, 9 ] }
{ _id: 6, type: "food", item: "bbb", ratings: [ 5, 9 ] }
{ _id: 7, type: "food", item: "ccc", ratings: [ 9, 5, 8 ] }
{ _id: 8, type: "food", item: "ddd", ratings: [ 9, 5 ] }
{ _id: 9, type: "food", item: "eee", ratings: [ 5, 9, 5 ] }
```

The collection has a multikey index on the `ratings` field:

```
db.inventory.createIndex( { ratings: 1 } )
```

The following query looks for documents where the `ratings` field is the array `[ 5, 9 ]`:

```
db.inventory.find( { ratings: [ 5, 9 ] } )
```

MongoDB can use the multikey index to find documents that have `5` at any position in the `ratings` array. Then, MongoDB retrieves these documents and filters for documents whose ratings array equals the query array `[ 5, 9 ]`.

## `$expr`

`$expr` does not support multikey indexes.

## Examples

### Index Basic Arrays

Create a `survey` collection with the following document:

```
db.survey.insertOne(
   { _id: 1, item: "ABC", ratings: [ 2, 5, 9 ] }
)
```

Create an index on the field `ratings`:

```
db.survey.createIndex( { ratings: 1 } )
```

Since the `ratings` field contains an array, the index on `ratings` is multikey. The multikey index contains the following three index keys, each pointing to the same document:

-   `2`,
-   `5`, and
-   `9`.

### Index Arrays with Embedded Documents

You can create multikey indexes on array fields that contain nested objects.

Consider an `inventory` collection with documents of the following form:

```
{
  _id: 1,
  item: "abc",
  stock: [
    { size: "S", color: "red", quantity: 25 },
    { size: "S", color: "blue", quantity: 10 },
    { size: "M", color: "blue", quantity: 50 }
  ]
}
{
  _id: 2,
  item: "def",
  stock: [
    { size: "S", color: "blue", quantity: 20 },
    { size: "M", color: "blue", quantity: 5 },
    { size: "M", color: "black", quantity: 10 },
    { size: "L", color: "red", quantity: 2 }
  ]
}
{
  _id: 3,
  item: "ijk",
  stock: [
    { size: "M", color: "blue", quantity: 15 },
    { size: "L", color: "blue", quantity: 100 },
    { size: "L", color: "red", quantity: 25 }
  ]
}
...
```

The following operation creates a multikey index on the `stock.size` and `stock.quantity` fields:

```
db.inventory.createIndex( { "stock.size": 1, "stock.quantity": 1 } )
```

The compound multikey index can support queries with predicates that include both indexed fields as well as predicates that include only the index prefix `"stock.size"`, as in the following examples:

```
db.inventory.find( { "stock.size": "M" } )
db.inventory.find( { "stock.size": "S", "stock.quantity": { $gt: 20 } } )
```

For details on how MongoDB can combine multikey index bounds, see [Multikey Index Bounds](#multikey-index-bounds).

The compound multikey index can also support sort operations, such as the following examples:

```
db.inventory.find( ).sort( { "stock.size": 1, "stock.quantity": 1 } )
db.inventory.find( { "stock.size": "M" } ).sort( { "stock.quantity": 1 } )
```
