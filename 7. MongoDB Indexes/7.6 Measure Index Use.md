# Measure Index Use

## Get Index Access Information with `$indexStats`

Use the `$indexStats` aggregation stage to get statistics regarding the use of each index for a collection. For example, the following aggregation operation returns statistics on the index use on the `orders` collection:

```
db.orders.aggregate( [ { $indexStats: { } } ] )
```

## Return Query Plan with `explain()`

Use the `db.collection.explain()` or the `cursor.explain()` method in **executionStats** mode to return statistics about the query process, including the index used, the number of documents scanned, and the time the query takes to process in milliseconds.

Run `db.collection.explain()` or the `cursor.explain()` method in **allPlansExecution** mode to view partial execution statistics collected during plan selection.

## Control Index Use with `hint()`

To force MongoDB to use a particular index for a `db.collection.find()` operation, specify the index with the `hint()` method. Append the `hint()` method to the `find()` method. Consider the following example:

```
db.people.find(
   { name: "John Doe", zipcode: { $gt: "63000" } }
).hint( { zipcode: 1 } )
```

To view the execution statistics for a specific index, append to the `db.collection.find()` the `hint()` method followed by `cursor.explain()`, e.g.:

```
db.people.find(
   { name: "John Doe", zipcode: { $gt: "63000" } }
).hint( { zipcode: 1 } ).explain("executionStats")
```

Or, append `hint()` method to `db.collection.explain().find()`:

```
db.people.explain("executionStats").find(
   { name: "John Doe", zipcode: { $gt: "63000" } }
).hint( { zipcode: 1 } )
```

Specify the `$natural` operator to the `hint()` method to prevent MongoDB from using any index:

```
db.people.find(
   { name: "John Doe", zipcode: { $gt: "63000" } }
).hint( { $natural: 1 } )
```
