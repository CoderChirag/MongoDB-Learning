# Cursors in MongoDB

Cursor is a **pointer to the result set of a query**. Clients can iterate through a cursor to retrieve results.

By default, cursors not opened within a session automatically timeout after 10 minutes of inactivity. Cursors opened under a session close with the end or timeout of the session. See Iterate a Cursor in mongosh.
